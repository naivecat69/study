THE 1 OCTAVE GRAPHIC EQUALIZER HAS ACONTROL THAT ADJUSTS THE AUDIO AT EACH OCTAVE ACROSS THE AUDIO SPECTRUM,GENERALLY HAVING 10 CONTROLS. THE 1/3 OCTAVE GRAPHIC EQUALIZER HAS THREETIMES AS MANY CONTROLS, WHICH CAN BOOST OR ATTENUATE 30 DIFFERENT PARTS OFTHE AUDIO SPECTRUM. A MAJORITY OF THE CONTROLS OF MOST GENERAL AUDIOGRAPHIC EQUALIZERS ARE UNUSABLE FOR HAM RADIO PURPOSES. FOUR OF THE 10CONTROLS ON A 1 OCTAVE EQUALIZER AND 13 OF THE 30 CONTROLS ON A 1/3 OCTAVEEQUALIZER WILL BE USABLE WITHIN THE HAM BANDWIDTH. MOST UTILIZE SHORTTHROW SLIDE POTENTIOMETERS, WHICH CAN GIVE YOU A VISUAL DISPLAY OF YOUREQUALIZATION CURVE. BUT BECAUSE MOST OF THIS CONTROL IS OUTSIDE THE HAMAUDIO BANDWIDTH, SEVERAL MANUFACTURERS HAVE RECENTLY COME UP WITH GRAPHIC= END OF 20 WPM TEXT = QST DE W1AW <"
250805_40WPM.mp3,"= NOW 40 WPM = TWEAKING THE VARIOUS ADJUSTMENTS, NEVER BEING SURE IF ITS OPTIMALLYADJUSTED. EQUALIZATION AND YOUR MICROPHONE LIKE ALL OF THESEEQUALIZERS, YOUR MICROPHONE WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE LESS THAN A FLATRESPONSE, SO YOUR FIRST TASK WILL BE TO ADJUST THE MICROPHONE SOTHAT IT HAS A RELATIVELY FLAT RESPONSE. THEN, YOU CAN TWEAK THESOUND TO ENHANCE THE PORTIONS THAT GIVE YOU THE MAXIMUM PERFORMANCEFOR ITS INTENDED USAGE. IF YOURE A CONTESTER OR DXER, THERE WILL BEDIFFERE EQUALIZATION AND HAM RADIO LINDY WILLIAMS, K6EB IN THE APRIL2023 ISSUE, I DISCUSSED MICROPHONES AND HAM RADIO. THE SECOND TOPICTO DISCUSS IN SSB TRANSMITTED AUDIO IS EQUALIZATION. LIKEMICROPHONES, EQUALIZATION COMES IN MANY DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS.WITH A LITTLE BIT OF TIME SPENT ADJUSTING THE SOUND OF YOUR STATION,THE RESPONSE OF THE MICROPHONE, IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE, CAN BEMADE TO SOUND AS GOOD AS A MICROPHONE THAT COSTS THOUSANDS OFDOLLARS. HOW IT WORKS EQUALIZATION IS A PROCESS IN WHICH YOU CANCONTROL THE GAIN OF INDIVIDUAL FREQUENCIES WITHIN THE AUDIO BANDPASS OF YOUR TRANSCEIVER. SOME MICROPHONES, SUCH AS THOSE MADE BYHEIL SOUND AND SOME SPECIAL PURPOSE MICROPHONES MADE BY SHURE,ELECTRO VOICE, AND OTHERS, ARE DESIGNED WITH CUTS AND BOOSTS OVERTHE SSB BANDWIDTH TO GIVE YOU AN OPTIMUM RESPONSE FOR THE LIMITEDBANDWIDTH OF THE MEDIUM. THIS CAN BE A GOOD THING IF YOURTRANSCEIVER DOESNT HAVE EQUALIZATION OR HAS LIMITED EQUALIZATION.THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF YOUR AUDIO CHAIN CAN HAVE A MAJOR EFFECTON WHETHER THE LISTENER CAN DETERMINE WHAT YOURE SAYING. THIS ISNTTHE SAME AS HOW GOOD OR NATURAL YOUR AUDIO SOUNDS. IF YOURE TALKINGWITH ANOTHER HAM AND BOTH OF YOUR SIGNALS ARE FULL QUIETING ANDSTRONG, THE INTELLIGIBILITY ISNT NEARLY AS IMPORTANT AS WHEN YOURECOMMUNICATING ON THE VERY EDGE OF SIGNALS THAT ARE BARELY READABLE.ALSO, ITS IMPORTANT THAT YOUR CALL SIGN CAN PIERCE THROUGH A PILEUP.THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY PUTTING MAXIMUM ENERGY INTO THE FREQUENCIESOF YOUR TRANSMISSION THAT CONVEY INTELLIGIBILITY. THIS MAY MEANTHAT YOUR AUDIO WONT SOUND AS NATURAL AS IT WOULD IF YOU WERE HAVINGA LONG CONTACT ITS MORE ABOUT THE TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.DIFFERENT TYPES OF EQUALIZATION THERE ARE NUMEROUS TYPES OFEQUALIZATION, EACH HAVING A PLACE IN RECORDING, BROADCASTING, SOUNDENFORCEMENT, AND HAM RADIO. CUTOFF FILTER THE SIMPLEST FORM OFEQUALIZATION IS THE CUTOFF FILTER, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS HIGH PASSAND LOW PASS FILTERS. THERE ARE ALSO NOTCH FILTERS THAT ATTENUATE ASPECIFIC FREQUENCY, BUT THEYRE RARELY USED IN HAM TRANSMISSIONS.THE HIGH PASS AND LOW PASS FILTERS ARE COMMON IN MOST TRANSCEIVERS.THE AUDIO PREAMPLIFIER IN MOST TRANSCEIVERS IS LIMITED BELOW ACERTAIN FREQUENCY, GENERALLY ABOUT 150 TO 300 HZ, AND LIMITED ON THEOTHER END, BETWEEN 2800 AND 3200 HZ. THIS IS ONLY A FRACTION OF THERESPONSE OF THE HUMAN EAR, OR THE RESPONSE OF A HIGH END MICROPHONE.BECAUSE THE RESPONSE IS SO LIMITED, ITS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT TOMAKE THAT RESPONSE AS PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE.= END OF 40 WPM TEXT = QST DE W1AW <"

THE ORDER WENT SMOOTHLY, BUT WITH THECOVID PANDEMIC, THE SHIPMENT GOT DELAYED AT THE PORT FOR A WEEK. IN3 WEEKS, TWO LARGE ORANGE CYLINDERS AND A BOX WERE DELIVERED TO MYDRIVEWAY. WHILE I HAD BEEN WAITING ON THE SHIPMENT, WALDEK, SP7GXP,FROM GXP ANTENNAS, HAD SENT AHEAD THE DIRECTIONS MORE ON THIS LATERAND TOLD ME TO REPORT ANY DAMAGE. HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE PIPESWOULD BE PACKE OPERATING THE X6100 AS YOU CAN SEE IN FIGURE 3, THEDISPLAY IS QUITE EASY TO READ AND PROVIDES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OFSIMULTANEOUS INFORMATION. VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ISSHOWN INCLUDING THE RECEIVE SPECTRUM, FILTER BANDWIDTH, WATERFALL,AND ALL THE DIFFERENT OPERATING PARAMETERS. THE CONTROLS ANDBUTTONS ARE PRETTY MUCH SELF EXPLANATORY, THOUGH THE DUAL FUNCTIONBUTTONS AND CONTROLS NEED A BIT MORE EXPLAINING. THE SIX BUTTONS ATTOPSIDE RIGHT SEE FIGURE 4 ARE DUAL FUNCTION. THE NORMAL FUNCTION,DISPLAYED ON THE BUTTON, IS ENABLED BY TAPPING THE BUTTON. THESECONDARY FUNCTION, AS LABELED ABOVE OR BELOW THE BUTTON, IS ENABLEDBY PRESSING AND HOLDING THE BUTTON. AS AN EXAMPLE, TO ENABLE THEATU AUTOMATIC TUNER, TAP THE ATU BUTTON. FOR THE ATU TO TUNE, PRESSAND HOLD THE ATU BUTTON. THE VOLUME CONTROL, WHEN TAPPED, CHANGESFUNCTION FROM AF GAIN TO RF GAIN, TO SQUELCH. CW OPERATION THEN ITWAS TIME TO HAVE FUN WITH THE X6100. I BEGAN WITH MY FAVORITE MODECW. TAPPING THE KEY BUTTON PERMITS YOU TO ADJUST KEYING SPEED, KEYTYPE, IAMBIC KEYER MODE, CW TONE FREQUENCY, AND MONITOR TONE LEVEL.TAP KEY AGAIN AND YOU CAN SET THE BREAK IN TIME DELAY, THE DOT/DASHRATIO, AND TURN THE CW TRAINER ON AND OFF. THE INTERNAL KEYER SPEEDRANGE IS 5 50 WPM. SINCE I ADJUST KEYING SPEED FREQUENTLY, INORMALLY LEAVE THE KEY1 MENU UP. YOU CAN SELECT EITHER CW OR CWRREVERSE WITH THE CW MODE KEY ON THE TOP OF THE RADIO. THERE ARETHREE DEFAULT FILTER BANDWIDTHS 500 HZ, 250 HZ, AND 150 HZ. EACH OFTHESE FILTER BANDWIDTHS CAN BE READJUSTED TO SUIT THE USER. BREAKIN DELAY CAN BE SET FROM 0 1 SECONDS IN 10 MS INCREMENTS. HOWEVER,THE DELAY WILL NEVER BE LESS THAN 100 MS DUE TO THE SDR SIGNALPROCESSING LATENCY. I SET THE BREAK IN DELAY TO 250 MS TO MINIMIZETHE T/R RELAY CLICKING. I OPERATED CW ON 40, 30, AND 20 METERS.THE CW REPORTS WERE ALL EXCELLENT, WITH NO REPORTS OF KEY CLICKS ORCHIRPS. SSB OPERATION I OPERATED SSB A BIT ON 40 METERS, BUT MOSTLYON 20 AND 17 METERS. TEN W IS A PRETTY MARGINAL POWER LEVEL FOR SSBON 40 METERS, BUT IT IS REASONABLY EFFECTIVE ON THE HIGHER BANDS.THE THREE SSB DEFAULT RECEIVE FILTER BANDWIDTHS ARE 2700 HZ, 2400HZ, AND 1800 HZ. AGAIN, THE FILTER BANDWIDTHS CAN BE MODIFIEDEASILY IF DESIRED. ALL TRANSMIT AUDIO REPORTS WERE COMPLIMENTARY.THERE IS NO SPEECH PROCESSOR YET, AND THE ONLY TRANSMIT ADJUSTMENTYOU CAN MAKE IS MICROPHONE GAIN. DIGITAL MODES THE X6100 CAN BEOPERATED WITH A COMPUTER AND SOUND CARD FOR RTTY, PSK, JT65, OR ANYOF THE OTHER POPULAR DIGITAL MODES. THE COMPUTER= END OF 40 WPM TEXT = QST DE W1AW < "
